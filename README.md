FT2232H Asynchronous FIFO Test


This code is under development and is flawed.  Will be correcting this soon.  This is an attempt to use the Xilinx Spartan 3e starter kit to talk to the PC over USB using a FT2232H mini module configured as an Asynchronous FIFO.  The verilog code for the FPGA and the code on the PC is provided.  The PC code buffer overflows and need to correct that.
